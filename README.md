# Floyd_Warshall
Floyd_Warshall algorithm for all-pairs shortest-path problem.

In the input file, the first line indicates the number of vertices and edges, respectively.  Each subsequent line describes an edge (the first two numbers are its tail and head, respectively) and its length (the third number).  Some of the edge lengths are negative.  These graphs may or may not have negative-cost cycles.
